## Introduction

Jekyll is a popular static site generator for creating blogs, documentation, and personal websites.

Bundler is a package manager for Ruby, which helps manage dependencies in Jekyll projects.

This guide goes through the process of installing Jekyll and Bundler in Vanilla OS using apx.

## Installing Jekyll and Bundler

Open your preferred Terminal emulator/application, and follow the steps to install it in a specific container.

### Ubuntu container

Enter the container using the following command:-

```bash
apx enter
```

Install the required prerequisite packages using the following command:-

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

After installation, execute the following commands:-

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, install Jekyll and Bundler using the following command:-

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

You have now successfully installed the packages. You can execute them using `apx run <command>`, or directly by entering the container using `apx enter`.

Optionally, you can export the binary to use it from the host directly without requiring the `apx run` command. You can do this by using the following commands:-

```bash
apx export --bin jekyll
apx export --bin bundler
```

### Fedora container

Enter the container using the following command:-

```bash
apx enter --dnf
```

Install the required prerequisite packages using the following command:-

```bash
sudo dnf install ruby ruby-devel make gcc g++
```

Now, install Jekyll using the following command:-

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

You have now successfully installed the packages. You can execute them using `apx run --dnf <command>`, or directly by entering the container using `apx enter --dnf`.

Optionally, you can export the binary to use it from the host directly without requiring the `apx run --dnf` command. You can do this by using the following commands:-

```bash
apx export --dnf --bin jekyll
apx export --dnf --bin bundler
```

### Arch Linux container

Enter the container using the following command:-

```bash
apx enter --aur
```

Install the required prerequisite packages using the following command:-

```bash
sudo pacman -S ruby base-devel
```

Now, install Jekyll using the following command:-

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

You have now successfully installed the packages. You can execute them using `apx run --aur <command>`, or directly by entering the container using `apx enter --aur`.

Optionally, you can export the binary to use it with the host directly without requiring the `apx run --aur` command. You can do this by using the following commands:-

```bash
apx export --aur --bin jekyll
apx export --aur --bin bundler
```

## Testing sites using Jekyll locally

Navigate to the required directory for the site.

Optionally, Run `bundler install` to install necessary packages (This step is required only once and doesn't require re-running it in future. You must have a Gemfile in the repository for this command to work).

Run `jekyll build` or `bundler exec jekyll build` to build the page to `./_site` once.

Then you can either test the pages manually or use `jekyll serve` or `bundler exec jekyll serve` command to build your site any time a source file changes and serve it locally.

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` or `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to preview and test the page.

**_Tip_**:-

You can test your pages on your phone using `bundler exec jekyll serve --host=<ip>`.

Using `0.0.0.0` instead of a specific IP binds port 4000 to any interface, which is prone to be blocked by your routers firewalls. That's why we recommended using a particular IP address with the `--host` flag. After executing the command in any browser on your phone, go to this address `<ip>:4000`.

For example, if the IP you used is `192.168.0.123`, you will need to visit `192.168.0.123:4000` on your mobile.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully installed Jekyll & Bundler via the command line and successfully served and tested your site locally.
